## Learning resources

I often find myself linking people the same things. I will collect my links to learn stuff here.

### Computers

* Developer Roadmap <https://roadmap.sh>

#### Docker and Kubernetes
Docker
* Docker Docs - <https://docs.docker.com/get-started/>
* Docker interactive tutorial - <https://www.katacoda.com/courses/docker>

Kubernetes
* Kubernetes Learning Path - <https://github.com/microsoft/kubernetes-learning-path>
* Kubernetes official docs (very good and de facto place to go during day to day k8s usage, might be a bit less beginner unfriendly) - <https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/>
