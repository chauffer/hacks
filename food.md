# Parmigiano

Best parmigiano I ever had. Ships to EU.

- [1kg 12 months old - amazing to eat by itself](https://www.amazon.it/Parmigiano-Reggiano-Dop-OGM-mesi/dp/B01CYS2BIY)
- [1kg 24 months old - if you have to get only one, get this one, balanced](https://www.amazon.it/Parmigiano-Reggiano-Dop-Ogm-Mesi/dp/B01CYDKC80/)
- [1kg 36 months old - great for cooking, full of flavour, impossible for me to eat more than a few g at once like this](https://www.amazon.it/Parmigiano-Reggiano-Dop-Ogm-Mesi/dp/B01CYJHH28)
